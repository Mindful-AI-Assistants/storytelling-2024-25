## 📜 About Storytelling

Storytelling is the art of telling stories, essential in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for effectively communicating findings and insights.

Through Storytelling, students learn to transform raw data into stories that inform, persuade, and inspire. This is crucial because while data analysis can reveal valuable insights, these insights are useless if they cannot be effectively communicated.

The Storytelling discipline in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence undergraduate program at PUC-SP aims to equip students with the necessary skills to tell effective stories with data. 

<br>

- **Key Storytelling** concepts include:

  <br>
  
   - ***Narrative***: The structure and flow of the story you are telling with your data. <br>
     
   - ***Data Visualization***: The graphical representation of data to highlight trends and patterns. <br>
     
   - ***Context***: The background information that helps frame and interpret the data .<br>
     
   - ***Simplicity***: The ability to convey complex information in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. <br>

<br>

## 📚 Projects

Here, you will find a variety of projects developed during the course. ach project is an opportunity to explore and apply the concepts learned in the classroom, allowing us to tell powerful stories with data.
